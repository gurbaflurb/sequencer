# Sequencer
To answer this question when posed to my brain which likes to see practical examples side by side theory.

In case it's deleted see the below question:
Flip a fair coin 100 timesâ€”it gives a sequence of heads (H) and tails (T). For each HH in the sequence of flips, Alice gets a point; for each HT, Bob does, so e.g. for the sequence THHHT Alice gets 2 points and Bob gets 1 point. Who is most likely to win?

## According to Twitter:
Poll results are (as of 1735 UTC 17 MARCH 2024):
- Alice wins - 26.3% of people voted
- Bob wins - 10.2% of people voted
- Equally Likely - 42.8% of people voted
- See results - 20.7% of people voted

- Tl;dr Bob will end with more points than Alice on average. 

## Conclusion
Running many tests, it would appear that Bob, generally, over many, many, many rounds, wins slightly more than Alice.

Rounds used: 10000

In general, if you run a long enough sequence, Bob will eventually win by a hair. Smaller sequences, appear to be more 50/50. Even at 1000 rounds of 1000 coin flips each, the results still appeared to be 50/50. It wasn't until after the 10,000 rounds
